                                Ziman Zhang was born in China and moved to the United States before her teenage years. She started living by herself since 13! Had endured all the cold weather in both China and the East Coast, now she's happily residing in California.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ziman graduated from UC Berkeley last year with a focus on Psychology. She's been working in marketing, content strategy and investor relations since. Eventually, her dream is to have her own company!

                            <p>
                                Oh and she enjoys good food and wine. Loves dancing and good company. Ummm... also CATS! Ziman's family has been calling her "Cat" since she was a child. She's even thinking about adding that to her middle name legally besides "Monica".. umm or maybe "Monicatz"? Let's see! ;)
